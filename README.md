# Portfolio

My name is Sigal Minsky-Primus and I'm a rising sophomore at the Bronx High School of Science.

## Relevant Coursework

### 8th grade

I homeschooled for that year, so my courses were less traditional.

- **Bioinformatics Algorithms**, more information on the coursework and some code that I wrote (in OCaml) can be found [here](https://github.com/sigalrmp/Bioinformatics-Portfolio)
- **AP Computer Science A Prep**, a few weeks long, consisted of getting used to Java and doing practice problems and tests
  -   In the spring of that year, I took the APCS A exam, and got a 5.
- **Geometry**, an online course offered by Art of Problem Solving, more information [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/course/intro-geometry)
  
### 9th grade

- **Game Development**, a post-AP CS course, mostly done in C# programming in Unity. In addition to the regular coursework, I worked on three independent projects:
  - Implimenting several maze generation algotithms (2d and 3d) and rendering them in Unity
  - Writing an AI and multiplayer UI for ultimate tic-tac-toe, in OCaml, found [here](https://github.com/sigalrmp/Ultimate-Tic-Tac-Toe)
  - Solving and generating combinatorial puzzles like Sudoku and Hashi, in Python, found [here](https://github.com/sigalrmp/puzzles-2022)
- **Honors Precalculus**, offered by the Bronx High School of Science, covering topics including trigenometry, polar equations, vectors and matrices.

## Other experience

- - **Scheme**, I coded regularly at home in Scheme from the age of 9 until 8th grade
- **Counting and Probability**, taken the summer between 7th and 8th grade, an online couse offered by Art of Problem Solving, more information [here](https://artofproblemsolving.com/school/course/intro-counting)
- **Robotics**, I'm part of the progrramming department of my school's robotics team
