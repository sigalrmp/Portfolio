# Portfolio

My name is Sigal Minsky-Primus and I'm a rising sophomore at the Bronx High School of Science.

## Relevant Coursework

### 8th grade

I homeschooled for that year, so my courses were less traditional.

- **Bioinformatics Algorithms**, more information on the coursework and some code that I wrote (in OCaml) can be found [here](https://github.com/sigalrmp/Bioinformatics-Portfolio)
- **AP Computer Science A Prep**, a few weeks long, consisted of practicing and getting used to Java and using practice tests and problems
  -   In the spring of that year, I took the APCS A exam, and got a 5.
  
### 9th grade

- **Game Development**, a post-AP CS course, mostly done in C# programming in Unity. In addition to the regular coursework, I worked on three independent projects:
  - Implimenting several maze generation algotithms (2d and 3d) and rendering them in Unity
  - Writing an AI and multiplayer UI for ultimate tic-tac-toe, in OCaml
  - Solving and generating combinatorial puzzles like Sudoku and Hashi, in Python

### Other

I'm happy to do whatever would be the most useful, but I have no experience in and do not enjoy front-end work. I've been coding at home since I was little, and am most familiar with Scheme, Python, Java, C#, and OCaml (similar to Haskell), but I'm pretty quick to pick up new languages. In terms of concrete experience:

I spent some time last year following an online bioinformatics course, where I did genomic analysis problems which were mostly algorithmic. 
This year, I took a game development course at my school (Bronx Science). I'm not particularly interested in gaming or game development, but I did some interesting work, including projects on maze generation, board game AIs, and puzzle generation. 
I'm also on the programming department of my school's robotics team, but the majority of the programming I've done this year has not been for robotics. 
The repository I'll send over tomorrow will have more details on a lot of this, as well as the actual code for a few projects I've done. Please let me know if you have any questions, or if there's any more information that you'd like.
